# Discord Message Display UI

## Overview

This project is a user interface (UI) for displaying Discord messages organized by channel categories. The UI provides an intuitive and organized view of messages, making it easy for users to follow conversations within different channels.

## Features

- **Automatic Categorization**: Messages are automatically sorted into channel categories, allowing users to quickly navigate and find relevant discussions.

- **Real-time Updates**: The UI ensures real-time updates, keeping users informed about the latest messages in each category.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The design prioritizes simplicity and user-friendliness, making it accessible for both experienced and new Discord users.
